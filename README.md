# Dagoy - Content Sharing Platform (API)

Dagoy is a content platform for users to share their content. The concept is that you cannot follow any users, to keep content democracy on a high level and nobody gets to ride on the "high follower number bluff = quality".. What you can do on Dagoy is bookmark posts, filter them by category and also like posts if you appreciate a users content. 

Each user has access to their own profile once they are signed in where they can create posts, see all their bookmarks, edit their profile image and password.

If anyone needs to get in touch with the admin, they can fill out the contact form and the Admin will haveget in touch as soon as possible.
